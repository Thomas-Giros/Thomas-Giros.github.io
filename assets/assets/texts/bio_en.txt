I was first introduced to computers via the Python language and musical creation during my studies at the University of Montreal.
Music has always been part of my life but programming has become an essential tool for me.
So I continued my studies at the University of Quebec in Montreal to improve my knowledge in the field.
It is difficult to make a choice for your career as there are so many opportunities in IT.
I first worked as an analyst-programmer in order to participate in the production of software packages for transport companies at GIRO.
Then I wanted to take a step back to reorient myself. This is how I turned to mobile application development and cross-platform development.
